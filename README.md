This is the first Django project I developed without putting in too much effort, using the basic knowledge of Django.

Regarding the open-source code I shared for the project, on the backend side, I used Django, Python's web framework. On the frontend side, since I don't know how to design, I simply designed the pages with my basic knowledge of HTML and Bootstrap. The project contains two applications: Blogs and Users. The Blogs application allows the user to interact with blogs on the site, while the Users application handles user sessions. You can access the HTML codes of the page designs in the templates folder.

The aim of my project was not to present it to any user, but to create a system using my basic Django knowledge. Therefore, there may be some errors on the website.
